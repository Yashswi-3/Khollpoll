Thia was my first ever project its an 100 percent pythhon project and i have used pythn liberary streamlit in this project.

General Overview
Basically, The idea behind this Project is to build a
bridge between the students and organisations of
      our university so that the Admins of the organisation
can easily pitch the upcoming information easily 
    and directly with all transparency to the students.  
 
 Mess review
As all of you know that the food in Mess is very inconsistent in
taste and any of the student of our university cannot rate or 
review the food item and due to this the Mess in charge is not
able to solve the issues.
In order to solve this problem we will be adding Mess review  
feature in our Web-app which will allow the students to review
and rate the food items in Mess and everyone will be able to see
 what rating others have given and overall rating which will
force the Mess staff to improve the quality and taste of food.
 
 Events
A few days ago, we missed a very important event related
to software development due to lack of information and 
felt guilty.
This gave us the idea that we should make a web page or app 
which will have all the upcoming, ongoing and past events
with the venue, registration link and basic information related
to the event. So we implemented this idea in our Kholl Poll. 

Daily Feeds
Nowadays, most of the students in our university don't usually
have the time to read the newspaper due to hectic schedule
 and newspaper also don't have a section regarding the daily updates
and achievement of our university. 
So, to keep students up to date regarding the goings in our
university we are bringing Daily Feeds in Kholl Poll which 
will keep the students up to date.
